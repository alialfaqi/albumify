## Description

An SPA using the [jsonplaceholder fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), to get, add, edit users and view their details.

## Directions

To start the app, first start the local server by running `json-server users.json --watch` inside the data folder to get the registered users to login or to sign up. You have to be a registered user to view the app. The server runs on `http://localhost:3000/users`

To start the project run `ng serve -o`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
